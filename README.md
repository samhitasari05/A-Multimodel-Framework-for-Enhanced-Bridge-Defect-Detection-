#üèóÔ∏è Multimodal Bridge Defect Detection with Cross-Verification

Welcome to the repository for our IEEE-published pilot study on structural health monitoring of bridges using a multimodal data fusion framework. This project introduces a novel integration of Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) signals with adaptive image processing to accurately detect and verify bridge defects. The framework was developed, tested, and validated using real-world data sourced from the Federal Highway Administration‚Äôs InfoBridge platform.

üîç Overview

Bridges across the globe are aging rapidly, and traditional inspection techniques often fall short in detecting subsurface defects like delamination, cracking, or debonding. This project addresses this challenge by:

Fusing Impact Echo (IE) and Ultrasonic Surface Waves (USW) datasets to pinpoint defect-prone areas.
Applying Alpha Shape Analysis (ASA) to extract overlapping regions indicating structural anomalies.
Validating these defect zones through adaptive image processing techniques.
Reducing false positives through spatial and visual cross-verification.
This method enhances reliability, localization accuracy, and minimizes manual interpretation.

üß† Core Methodology

**1. Data Acquisition**
We use two key NDE techniques:

Impact Echo (IE): Detects internal defects such as voids and cracks using peak frequency analysis.
Ultrasonic Surface Waves (USW): Measures concrete elasticity to identify surface degradation or stiffness loss.
Both datasets were downloaded from the InfoBridge portal for a selected bridge (e.g., I-220 over John R. Lynch Street in Mississippi).

**2. Data Preprocessing & Feature Extraction**
IE data (voltage arrays) is converted to frequency domain using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
USW data is processed to calculate the elasticity modulus using time-delay estimation and wave velocity formulas.

**3. Defect Filtering Using K-Means**
K-means clustering (K=3) segments both datasets.
IE: Detects low-frequency regions.
USW: Detects low-modulus areas.
Thresholds from clustering help isolate high-risk zones.

**4. Multimodal Fusion with Alpha Shapes**
We apply Alpha Shape Analysis (ASA) to each modality.
The intersection of Œ±IE and Œ±USW defines common defect-prone zones.
These zones are spatially contextualized using unified lane boundaries.

**5. Image-Based Cross Verification**
Contour images of IE and USW from InfoBridge are processed:
HSV-based color masking detects red-yellow regions indicating potential defects.
Morphological operations (e.g., erosion/dilation) remove noise.
Bounding boxes are created around significant contours.
Detected defects are mapped to real-world coordinates.
Fused data from multimodal analysis is overlaid on these processed images to verify alignment.

**6. Evaluation Metrics**
Precision: 0.75
Recall: 0.92
F1-score: 0.83
These metrics are computed using micro-averaging across IE and USW fusion results.
